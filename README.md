# Web-Scrapping-
Web scrapping using BeautifulSoup
Project Overview
For this project, I assumed the role of a data scientist/data analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. The job is to extract financial data like historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks worked on are Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.

Dashboard Analytics Displayed

A dashboard often provides a view of key performance indicators. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment. We will be using Plotly in this course for data visualization and is not a requirement to take this course.

For this project, I used Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses.
